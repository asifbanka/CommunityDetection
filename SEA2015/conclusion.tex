In this paper we presented a fast, user-centric and flexible 
algorithm for discovering communities in social networks. 
We have established that it yields results that are competitive 
with those of the state-of-the-art techniques. The heart of the 
algorithm relies on solving a symmetrically diagonally dominant 
system of linear equations. Consequently, any progress---both theoretical 
or practical---in solving such systems translates directly 
to the efficiency of our approach. Solving SDD systems is currently a topic
of great interest and we may expect fast SDD solvers in the near future. 
In the mean time, we could use approximate iterative techniques that usually 
behave well in practice.

There are several ways we might extend our approach. One possibility is to 
bootstrap our algorithm by first running a different algorithm to obtain 
a first approximation of the communities in the network. The next step 
would be to pick seed nodes from among the communities thus found 
(without user intervention) and use our algorithm to refine 
the community structure. Another possibility would be to use a 
clustering algorithm on the affinity vectors so that the number of 
communities detected is significantly higher than the number of 
seed nodes.
