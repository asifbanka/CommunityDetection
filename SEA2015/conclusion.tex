Our algorithm seems to work very well with around 6$\%$ seed nodes for the 
non-overlapping case and around 8$\%$ seed nodes for the overlapping case. 
For the non-overlapping case, we can work with a mixing factor of up 
to~$0.5$, whereas in the overlapping case a mixing factor of $0.3$ 
and with the overlapping fraction of around $20\%$. This of course 
suggests that our algorithm has a higher tolerance while detecting 
non-overlapping communities and needs either a ``well-structured''
network or a high seed node percentage for overlapping communities. 
None of this is really surprising. What is surprising is that such 
a simple algorithm manages to do so well at all. We discuss some 
plausible ways to extend our approach in the appendix.
