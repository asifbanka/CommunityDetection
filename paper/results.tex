As in the last section, we first discuss our results for the non-overlapping case followed by 
the ones for the overlapping case.

\subsection{Non-overlapping communities}
Figures~\ref{fig:no_iter_no_overlap}, \ref{fig:iter_no_overlap}, and~\ref{fig:compare_iter_no_overlap}
show the plots that we obtained for non-overlapping communities. Figure~\ref{fig:no_iter_no_overlap}
shows tests for the non-iterative method of our algorithm with 5, 10, 15, and 20$\%$ seed nodes per 
community. The first observation here is that with 5$\%$ seed nodes will probably not give good results.  
With a seed node percentage of 10$\%$ or more and a mixing factor of at most~$0.4$, we can compete 
with \textit{Infomap}, which was deemed to be one the best performing algorithms on the 
LFR benchmark~\cite{LF09}. The NMI in this case is $0.9$ or above \texttt{Check!}. 
Above a mixing factor of $0.4$, our algorithm has a worse performance than \textit{Infomod}. 

\texttt{Is this really required? Without a graphic about Infomod, this doesn't make much sense.}
Curiously enough, \textit{Infomod} achieves an NMI of around 1 till a mixing factor of around 
$0.6$ but then its performance drops steeply. Our drop begins more early but is not 
as steep.\texttt{having a comparative plot for Infomod would be nice at this point.}

In Figure~\ref{fig:iter_no_overlap} we show benchmarks for the iterative approach of 
our algorithm. When compared with the non-iterative results, we can see that after 
ten iterations we already get a huge improvement (See Figure~\ref{fig:compare_iter_no_overlap}). 
We can cut the amount of seed nodes in half and still get better results, if we use 
the iterative method. By using the same number of seed nodes we can get NMI 
improvements as high as $60$ percent.\\ \\ In Figure~\ref{fig:no_iter_overlap_1000N} 
and~\ref{fig:no_iter_overlap_5000N} we show our benchmark results for the overlapping 
case. In~\cite{LF09} only one algorithm was able to detect overlapping communities, 
and for that reason we only compare our results wit \textit{CFinder}~\cite{PDFV05}. 
The main thing that can be noticed is, that we perform a lot better on LFR graphs for 
a mixing factor of $0.3$. In the most extreme case of $1000$ nodes, big communities 
and a mixing factor of $0.3$ the \textit{CFinder} algorithm has $60$ percent NMI as 
its best result at zero percent overlapping nodes, and goes only down if one increases 
the fraction of overlapping nodes, whereas our algorithm starts at $80$ percent NMI 
even for $5$ percent seed nodes. If we use at least $10$ percent we can go up to 
an overlap of $0.3$ before we reach $60$ percent NMI.

For $5000$ nodes the results are similar but not as extreme. In conclusion we can 
say that our algorithm seems to perform better on LFR graphs and offers a better runtime 
compared to that of the exponential worst-case runtime of \textit{CFinder}.

In Figure~\ref{fig:iter_overlap_1000N} and~\ref{fig:iter_overlap_5000N} we 
have provided plots for the iterative method and a improvement plot 
in~\ref{fig:compare_iter_overlap}. Iteration yields an improvement, 
but it is not as drastic as in the non overlapping case, around $10$ percent at best.
