Many real-world graphs that model complex systems exhibit an organization 
into subgraphs that are more densely connected on the inside than between each other. 
Social networks such as Facebook and LinkedIn divide into groups of friends 
or coworkers, or business partners; scientific collaboration networks divide 
themselves into research communities; the World Wide Web divides into groups 
of related webpages. The nature and number of communities provide 
a useful insight into the structure and organization of networks. 

Discovering the community structure of networks is an 
important problem in network science and is the subject 
of intensive research~\cite{GN02, GN04, CNM04, RCC04, DM04, PDFV05, NL07, 
BGLL08, RB08, RN09}. Existing community detection algorithms are 
classified by whether they find disjoint (non-overlapping) 
communitities or overlapping communitities. Typically finding 
overlapping communitities is a much harder problem and most of the 
earlier community detection algorithms focussed on finding disjoint 
communities. A comparative analysis of several community detection algorithms 
(both non-overlapping and overlapping) was presented by Lancichinetti and Fortunato 
in~\cite{LF09}. Their paper proposes a test framework 
which comprises of testing algorithms on a set of benchmark graphs 
known as the LFR-benchmark with the test results being evaluated against 
the ground truth using an information-theoretic measure known as the \emph{normalized 
mutual information}. We closely follow this test framework in this paper. 


The notion of a community is a loose one and there is no well-accepted definition.
Different community detection algorithms use different measures to estimate 
the goodness of a partition. One of the very first algorithms due to 
Girvan and Newman~\cite{GN02} introduced a measure known as modularity 
which, given a partition of the nodes of the network, compares the fraction of 
inter-community edges with the edges that would be present if the edges had been 
added randomly while preserving the node degrees. Other authors such as Palla 
\etal~\cite{PDFV05} simply declare that communities are node sets that formed 
by overlapping maximal cliques. Other authors such as Rosvall and Bergstrom~\cite{RB08} 
define the goodness of a partition in terms of the number of bits required to 
describe per step of an infinite random walk in the network, the intuition being 
that in a ``correct'' partition, a random walker is likely to spend more time 
within communities rather than between communities, thereby decreasing the 
description of the walk. 

Another characteristic of existing community detection algorithms 
is that they are too slow. Algorithms that optimize modularity typically 
take $O(n^2)$ even on sparse networks. The overlapping clique finding 
algorithm of Palla \etal~\cite{PDFV05} take exponential time in the worst case.
In other cases, derivation of worst-case running time bounds are ignored. 

\paragraph{This paper.}
Given that it is unlikely that users of community detection algorithms 
would unanimously settle on one definition of what constitutes a community, 
we feel that existing algorithms totally ignore the \emph{user perspective}. To this 
end, we chose to design an algorithm that takes as input ``user preferences'' into 
account. The user is expected to classify a small set of nodes of the network 
into communities (which is typically 2\% of the nodes of each community in 
the disjoint communities case). Obviously this is possible only when the user has some 
information about the network, such as, what it represents, which nodes 
are the important ones and into which communities they are classified. We thus 
break out of the chicken-and-egg problem  by requiring that users specify 
the communities that they expect to find in a network. This situation is not 
as ridiculous as it sounds. You might happen to have data on the leading scientific 
authors in a co-authorship network and their fields of research but not data on 
all members of the network; you might know the political affiliations of
some of people in a social network and aim to discover political spectrum of 
the whole network with the aim, perhaps, to predict the outcome of an election;
\texttt{Some more examples??}


An important characteristic of algorithms surveyed in~\cite{LF09} 
is that the algorithms either find disjoint communities or overlapping 
ones. The techniques that typically optimize the goodness of a partition based 
on some optimization criteria yield disjoint communities. The ones that are 
designed to find overlapping communities such as the overlapping clique finding 
algorithm of Palla \etal~\cite{PDFV05} do not seem to yield very good results (see~\cite{LF09}).
Our algorithm naturally extends to the overlapping case. Of course, there is a higher 
price that has to be paid in that the number of nodes that need to be classified by the user 
is typically larger (5\% to 10\% of the nodes per community). The algorithm however 
does not need any major changes and we view this is as an aesthetically pleasing 
feature of our approach. 

Thirdly, in many of the approaches, the worst-case running time of the algorithms 
is neither stated nor analyzed. We show that our algorithm runs in time $O(k m \log n)$, 
where $k$ is the number of communities to be discovered (which is supplied by the user), 
$n$ and $m$ are the number of nodes and edges in the network. In the case of sparse graphs 
and a constant number of communities, the running time is $O(n \log n)$. Given that even 
an $O(n^2)$ time algorithm is computationally expensive, we seem to have reached the holy grail 
of a nearly linear time algorithm.

Finally, we provide an extensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm on the LFR benchmark
introduced by Lancichinetti, Fortunato and Radicchi in~\cite{LFR08, LF09}. In order to ensure 
a fair comparison with other algorithms reviewed in~\cite{LF09}, we used the same parameters 
to generate the benchmark graphs. \texttt{Briefly mention which parameters are relevant?}


This paper if organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:major_algorithms}, we review some 
of the more influential algorithms in community detection. In Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}, we 
describe our algorithm and analyze its running time. In Section~\ref{sec:experiments}, we present 
the experimental results. Finally we conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} with possibilities
of how our approach might be extended.
