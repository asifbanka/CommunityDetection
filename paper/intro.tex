Many real-world graphs that model complex systems 
exhibit an organization into subgraphs that are more 
densely connected internally that between each other. 
These subgraphs are called communities or modules or clusters 
and having no widely accepted definition~\cite{LF09, PDFV05}. 

Discovering the community structure of networks is an 
important problem in network science and is the subject 
of intensive research~\cite{GN02, GN04, BGLL08, RCC04, PDFV05, RB08, 
DM04, NL07, RN09}.
