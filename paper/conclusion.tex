Our algorithm seems to work very well with around 6$\%$ seed nodes for the 
non-overlapping case and around 8$\%$ seed nodes for the overlapping case. 
For the non-overlapping case, we can work with a mixing factor of up 
to~$0.5$, whereas in the overlapping case a mixing factor of $0.3$ 
and with the overlapping fraction of around $30\%$. This of course 
suggests that our algorithm has a higher tolerance while detecting 
non-overlapping communities and needs either a ``well-structured''
network or a high seed node percentage for overlapping communities. 
None of this is really surprising. What is mildly surprising is that such 
a simple algorithm manages to do so well at all.

We wish to point out that while the running time of our algorithm is 
$O(k \cdot m \cdot \log n)$, we do not know of any commercial solvers 
for SDD systems that run in $O(m \log n)$ time. Since we use the Cholesky 
factorization method from the C++ Eigen Library, it is unlikely that our 
implementation would be able to handle very large networks. This is 
not a serious disadvantage since we expect that in the near future 
we would have commercial SDD solvers implementing the Speilman-Teng 
algorithm. 

An obvious question is whether it is possible to avoid the semi-supervised 
step completely, that is, avoid having the user to specify seed nodes 
for every community.
