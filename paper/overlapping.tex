Detecting overlapping communities in a network is a harder problem than detecting non overlapping communities, because we do not know beforehand to how many communities a node might belong. The parameter used for the LFR benchmark were the same as in the previous section: $1000$ and $5000$ nodes, \textit{small} and \textit{big} communities and exponents of $-2$ and $-1$ for the degree and community distribution. This time however we do not vary the mixing factor $\mu$ but the fraction of nodes that lie in more than one community. We make seperate plots for a fixed mixing parameter of $0.1$ and $0.3$. This is again the same setup used by (same cite as previous section).
