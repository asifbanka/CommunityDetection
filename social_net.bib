abstract = { The music industry has repeatedly expressed concerns over potentially devastating impacts of online music sharing. Initial attempts to control online file sharing have been primarily through consumer education and legal action against the operators of networks that facilitated file sharing. Recent legal action against individual file sharers marked an unprecedented shift in the industry’s strategy. The focus now is on well‐publicized legal threats and actions on a relatively small group of individuals to discourage overall music file sharing. To determine the resulting impact of these legal threats, we passively tracked online file‐sharing behavior of over 2,000 individuals. We found that individuals who share a substantial number of music files react to legal threats differently from those who share a lesser number of files. Importantly, our analysis indicates that even after these legal threats and the resulting lowered levels of file sharing, the availability of music files on these networks remains substantial. }

                  time bounded log space auxiliary pushdown automata.
                  In particular, we introduce the notions of
                  (general), reach, and strong unambiguity and
                  fewness.  We demonstrate that closure under
                  complement of unambiguous classes implies
                  equivalence of unambiguity and ``unambiguous
                  fewness''.  This, as we will show, applies in the
                  cases of reach and strong unambiguity for log space.
                  Among the many relations we exhibit, we show that
                  the unambiguous linear contextfree languages, which
                  are not known to be contained in deterministic log
                  space, nevertheless are contained in strongly
                  unambiguous log space, and, consequently, are log
                  space reducible to deterministic contextfree
                  languages.},

                 peer-to-peer systems. Although several suggestions exist on how
                 to create a secure key-based routing protocol, a practicable
                 approach is still unattended. In this paper we introduce a
                 secure key-based routing protocol based on Kademlia that has a
                 high resilience against common attacks by using parallel
                 lookups over multiple disjoint paths, limiting free nodeId
                 generation with crypto puzzles and introducing a reliable
                 sibling broadcast. The latter is needed to store data in a safe
                 replicated way. We evaluate the security of our proposed
                 extensions to the Kademlia protocol analytically and simulate
                 the effects of multiple disjoint paths on lookup success under
                 the influence of adversarial nodes.}},

                  $\cal A$-uniform $NC^1$-circuits are of the same
                  computational power as \DLOGTIME-uniform
                  $NC^1$-circuits with oracle access to tally sets in
                  $\cal A$.  This characterization applies not only to
                  classes $\cal A$ such as $\L$ or $\P$ but to all in
                  some sense ``well-behaved'' classes and especially
                  to all standard complexity classes. We present many
                  applications for this characterization: among them
                  upward separations, depth-uniformity trade-offs, and
                  inclusion-completeness results for tally languages.}

        symbols. The language generated by a pattern is the set of
        all strings of constant symbols which can be obtained from
        the pattern by substituting non-empty strings for variables.
        We study the learnability of one-variable pattern languages
        in the limit with respect to the {\em update time} needed for
        computing
        a new single hypothesis and the {\em expected total learning
        time}
        taken until convergence to a correct hypothesis.
        Our results are as follows.

        First, we design a {\em consistent}
        and {\em set-driven} learner that, using the concept of
        descriptive patterns, achieves update time $O(n^2 log n)$,
        where $n$ is the size of the input sample. The best previously
        known algorithm for computing descriptive one-variable
        patterns
        requires time $O(n^4 log n)$ (cf.~Angluin~\cite{Angluin/80A}).
        Second, we give a parallel version of this algorithm that
        requires time $O(log n)$ and $O(n^3/log n)$ processors on
        an EREW-PRAM.},

  abstract =     {We present deterministic sorting and routing
                  algorithms for grids and tori with additional
                  diagonal connections.  For large loads ($h\geq 12$),
                  where each processor has at most $h$~data packets in
                  the beginning and in the end, the sorting problem
                  can be solved in optimal $hn/6+o(n)$ and
                  $hn/12+o(n)$~steps for grids and tori with
                  diagonals, respectively.  For smaller loads, we
                  present a new concentration technique that yields
                  very fast algorithms for~$h<12$.  For a load of~1,
                  the previously most studied case, sorting only takes
                  $1.2n+o(n)$ steps and routing only $1.1n+o(n)$
                  steps.  For tori, we can present optimal algorithms
                  for all loads $h\geq 1$.  The above algorithms all
                  use a constant size memory for all processors and
                  never copy or split packets, a property that the
                  corresponding lower bounds make use of.  If packets
                  may be copied, 1--1~sorting can be done in only
                  $2n/3+o(n)$ on a torus with diagonals.  Generally
                  gaining a speedup of~3 by only doubling the number
                  of communication links compared to a grid without
                  diagonals, our work suggests building grids and tori
                  {\em with\/} diagonals.},

Abstract = {Many security mechanisms are based on specific assumptions of identity and are vulnerable to attacks when these assumptions are violated. For example, impersonation is the well-known consequence when authenticating credentials are stolen by a third party. Another attack on identity occurs when credentials for one identity are purposely shared by multiple individuals, for example to avoid paying twice for a service. In this paper, we survey the impact of the Sybil attack, an attack against identity in which an individual entity masquerades as multiple simultaneous identities. The Sybil attack is a fundamental problem in many systems, and it has so far resisted a universally applicable solution. }, Bdsk-Url-1 = {http://prisms.cs.umass.edu/brian/pubs/levine.sybil.tr.2006.pdf}}

                  the cases when the depth of alternation is bounded

                  way we get new characterizations of classes like
                  $P^{NP[log]}$, $AC^k$, and $SAC^k$.  Finally, we

abstract = { The sharing of sound recordings over the Internet is the newest controversy in a long‐running battle between copyright owners and copying technologies. In order to provide some context, perspective, and background, this paper examines the short history of file sharing, the longer history of record sales, various explanations for the change in record sales, and some analysis of the economics of copying. Although file sharing has been imperfectly and inconsistently measured, it nevertheless appears to reveal a fairly close linkage between changes in file sharing and changes in record sales. Explanations, other than file sharing, for the recent decline in record sales seem to have little or no support. Because economic theories of the impacts of copying hold out little hope for a benign impact of file sharing, these results should not be surprising. These findings reinforce the econometric results from most of an expanding literature. }

                  (MaxSat) is: given a boolean formula in conjunctive
                  normal form, find a truth assignment that satisfies
                  the most number of clauses.  This paper describes
                  exact algorithms that provide new upper bounds for
                  MaxSat.  We prove that MaxSat can be solved in time
                  $O(|F| 1.3803^K)$, where $|F|$ is the length of a
                  formula~$F$ in conjunctive normal form and $K$ is
                  the number of clauses in~$F$. We also prove the time
                  bounds $O(|F| 1.3995^k)$, where $k$ is the maximum
                  number of satisfiable clauses, and $O(1.1279^{|F|})$
                  for the same problem.  For Max2Sat this implies a
                  bound of $O(1.2722^K)$.},

  abstract =     {CRCW-PRAMs can be characterized in terms of
                  unbounded fan-in circuits.  The idea of {\em
                  unambiguous circuits\/} leads to a characterization
                  of CREW-PRAMs. In this paper circuits are considered
                  which consist of OR and NOT gates and additionally
                  of gates that compute the {\em cartesian
                  product}. These circuit are equivalent to
                  traditional circuits composed of OR, AND, and NOT
                  gates. However, if fan-out is bounded this is no
                  longer true. If this concept is combined with the
                  concept of unambiguity of circuits, the resulting
                  circuits exactly characterize EREW-PRAMs. This
                  solves an open question posed by Stockmeyer and
                  Vishkin.  Furthermore, all other memory access
                  restrictions of PRAMs are shown to have a
                  characterization in terms of circuits with gates of
                  type OR, NOT, and cartesian product.}

                  recognized as efficiently by unambiguous auxiliary
                  pushdown automata (AuxPDAs) as unambiguous CFLs

                  time parallel recognition of unambiguous
                  context-free languages on CREW PRAM's. The first
                  algorithm combines the ideas of the algorithms given
                  in \cite{LR90a} and~\cite{Ryt87}.  The result
                  related to that algorithm is an unambiguous
                  decomposition of trees into smaller ones.  The
                  second algorithm is based on unique paths
                  decomposing trees into smaller subtrees.  It has a
                  shorter description and it is simpler to explain how
                  it works.  However, its correctness is
                  nontrivial. Both algorithms reduce the numbers of
                  processors by a linear factor in the case of general
                  unambiguous cfl's. For linear unambiguous cfl's the
                  number of processors is reduced to $O(n^2)$ by a
                  very simple algorithm. The paper shows how to remove
                  write conflicts in parallel computations on trees by
                  using two kinds of unique decompositions of trees.
                  Finally we show that our results can be generalized
                  for finitely ambiguous cfl's.}

  abstract =     { The present paper proposes a new learning model --
                  called {\it stochastic finite learning} -- and shows
                  the whole class of pattern languages to be learnable
                  within this model.  This main result is achieved by
                  providing a new and improved average-case analysis
                  of the Lange--Wie\-hagen (1991) algorithm learning
                  the class of all pattern languages in the limit from
                  positive data. The complexity measure chosen is the
                  {\it total learning time}, i.e., the overall time
                  taken by the algorithm until {\it convergence}.  The
                  expectation of the total learning time is carefully
                  analyzed and {\it exponentially} shrinking tail
                  bounds for it are established for a large class of
                  probability distributions. For every pattern $\pi$
                  containing $k$ different variables it is shown that
                  Lange and Wiehagen's algorithm possesses an expected
                  total learning time of $O(a^k(log_{1/b}(k)+2)E{L})$,
                  where $a$ and $b$ are two easy computable parameters
                  arising naturally from the underlying probability
                  distributions, and $E{L}$ is the expected example
                  string length.  Finally, assuming a bit of {\it
                  domain knowledge} concerning the underlying class of
                  probability distributions, it is shown how to
                  convert learning in the limit into {\it stochastic
                  finite learning}.},

  abstract =     {We analyze the owner concept for PRAMs.  In
                  OROW-PRAMs each memory cell has one distinct
                  processor that is the only one allowed to write into
                  this memory cell and one distinct processor that is
                  the only one allowed to read from it. By symmetric
                  pointer doubling, a new proof technique for
                  OROW-PRAMs, it is shown that list ranking can be
                  done in $O(\log n)$ time by an OROW-PRAM and that
                  $\LOGSPACE\subseteq\OROWTIME(\log n)$. Then we prove
                  that OROW-PRAMs are a fairly robust model and
                  recognize the same class of languages when the model
                  is modified in several ways and that all kinds of
                  PRAMs intertwine with the $\NC$-hierarchy without
                  timeloss. Finally it is shown that EREW-PRAMs can be
                  simulated by OREW-PRAMs and ERCW-PRAMs by
                  ORCW-PRAMs.}

abstract = { File sharing may substantially undermine the intellectual property rights of digital goods. This paper concentrates on the music industry. I estimate the effect of music downloads on the probability of purchasing music using a European individual‐level cross section of 15,000 people from 2001. A simple comparison of means shows that people who regularly download music online are more likely to buy music. The positive relationship persists when controlling for observed characteristics. However, simultaneity between tastes for music and peer‐to‐peer usage makes it difficult to isolate the causal effect of music downloads on music purchases. To break that simultaneity, this paper uses measures of Internet sophistication and the speed of the Internet connection as instruments. The results suggest that peer‐to‐peer usage reduces the probability of buying music by 30 percent. On the basis of my estimates, back‐of‐the‐envelope calculations indicate that—without downloads—sales in 2002 would have been around 7.8 percent higher. }
